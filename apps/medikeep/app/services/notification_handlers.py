Notification event handlers for the MediKeep event system.

This module subscribes to domain events from the event bus and sends
notifications via the NotificationService. It acts as a bridge between
the event system and the notification framework.

The handler:
- Receives domain events from the event bus
- Gets the template from the event registry
- Sends notification via NotificationService
- Logs success/failure
- Never raises exceptions (notification failures shouldn't break business logic)
