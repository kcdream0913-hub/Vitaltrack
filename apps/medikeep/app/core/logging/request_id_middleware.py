"""
Request ID Middleware for tracing requests across the application.

This middleware adds a unique request ID to each incoming request, making it
easier to trace a single request through all logs and debug production issues.

Features:
- Generates a short 8-character UUID for each request
- Adds request ID to request.state for access in endpoints
- Includes X-Request-ID header in all responses
