## Quick Start

### 1️⃣ Install Docker & Docker Compose

Ensure you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed.

### 2️⃣ Create docker-compose.yml

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file with content:

```yaml
services:
  # PostgreSQL Database Service
  postgres:
    image: postgres:15.8-alpine
    container_name: medical-records-db
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: ${DB_NAME:-medical_records}
      POSTGRES_USER: ${DB_USER:-medapp}
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: ${DB_PASSWORD}
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
      - ./postgres/init.sql:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/init.sql:ro
    ports:
      - '5432:5432'
    healthcheck:
      test:
        [
          'CMD-SHELL',
          'pg_isready -U ${DB_USER:-medapp} -d ${DB_NAME:-medical_records}',
        ]
      interval: 10s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 5
    restart: unless-stopped
    networks:
      - medical-records-network

# Named volumes for data persistence

# Network for service communication

```

#### Create a .env file(or copy the env.example in the docker folder)

```bash
# Environment variables for Docker Compose
# Copy this file to .env and update the values

# Database Configuration
DB_NAME=medical_records
DB_USER=medapp
# IMPORTANT: Use quotes if password contains # (e.g., "my#pass")
# Always escape $ as $$ (e.g., pass$$word). Safe chars: @ % ^ & * ( ) - _ . !
DB_PASSWORD=your_secure_database_password_here #Change me

# Application port
APP_PORT=8005

# Application Security Key (REQUIRED - sessions are ephemeral without this)
SECRET_KEY=your-very-secure-secret-key-for-jwt-tokens-change-this-in-production

TZ=America/New_York
LOG_LEVEL=INFO #INFO or DEBUG
DEBUG=false
ENABLE_API_DOCS=false  # Set to true to expose Swagger docs
ENABLE_SSL=false # false or true
```

### 3️⃣ Start the Containers

Run the following command to start the services:

```ini
docker compose up -d
```

Note: Do not use `docker-compose`.

### 4️⃣ Access the app

Once the containers are up, access the app in your browser at:

```ini
http://localhost:8005
```

### Default Login

On fresh installations, a default admin user is created:
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin123` (default)

**Customizing the Default Password:**

You can set a custom default admin password for fresh installations using the `ADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD` environment variable:

```bash
# Set in your .env file or as environment variable
ADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD=your_secure_password_here
```

**Note:** This only affects the initial admin user creation on fresh installations. It does not change passwords for existing users. Always change the default password after your first login.

## Backup and Restore

The app can be backed up using the Admin Dashboard.
Additionally, a backup/restore CLI is available.
This can be used with cron to automate scheduled backups.
See [Backup and Restore CLI](app/scripts/README_BACKUP_CLI.md) for more details.

Backups are stored under `/app/backups`. This should be mapped to
an external location or volume so that it can be stored safely in case a
restore is needed.

## SSO

The app has SSO capabilities.
As of right now, Google and Github are offically supported and tested.
ODIC SSO(keycloak, authlia, etc) should be supported but I haven't tested them yet.

See [SSO Quick Start](app/docs/SSO_QUICK_START.md) for google/github.

See [SSO Full Guide](app/docs/SSO_SETUP_GUIDE.md) for a more detailed guide.
