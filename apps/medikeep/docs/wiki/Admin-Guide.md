# Admin Guide

This guide covers the administrative features available to users with the **admin** role in MediKeep.

---

## Overview

Admin users have access to a dedicated Admin Panel with system-wide management capabilities. Regular users manage their own patients and records; admins can additionally manage users, reference data, backups, and system health.

To access the Admin Panel, click the **Admin** link in the navigation sidebar (visible only to admin users).

---

## Admin Dashboard

The Admin Dashboard provides a system overview at a glance:

- **User count** - Total registered users
- **Patient count** - Total patient profiles in the system
- **Storage usage** - Disk space used by uploads and documents
- **System health** - Database status and connectivity
- **Quick actions** - Shortcuts to common admin tasks

---

## User Management

Admins can manage all user accounts in the system.

### Viewing Users

- Browse all registered users with search and filter
- View user details including registration date, last login, and role

### Creating Users

- Create new user accounts with username, email, and password
- Assign role (user or admin)

### Editing Users

- Update user details (name, email)
- Change user roles

### Password Reset

- Reset a user's password from the admin panel
- The user will need to use the new password on their next login

### Deactivating / Deleting Users

- Deactivate users to prevent login without removing their data
- Delete user accounts (cascades cleanup of related data)

### Emergency Admin Recovery (CLI)

If every admin account is ever demoted, deactivated, or deleted, the admin panel itself becomes unreachable and no UI action can recover it. MediKeep ships a CLI recovery script (`app/scripts/create_emergency_admin.py`) that runs directly against the database and can either **promote an existing user back to admin** (preserving their password) or **create a fresh admin user**.

**Most common recovery — default `admin` account was demoted:**

```bash
docker exec -it <container_name> python app/scripts/create_emergency_admin.py --username admin
```

The script auto-detects state and picks promote-vs-create, shows a plan, asks for confirmation, and writes to both the security log and the activity log so the recovery action appears under the admin activity log after you regain access.

**Careful with role changes in the admin panel:** the User Management section above lets you edit roles, which includes demoting other admins. If you demote your *only* admin account (or demote yourself after deleting the other admins), the admin panel becomes immediately unreachable. The CLI recovery script is the only way back at that point. MediKeep also logs a `WARNING`-level security event on every app startup when zero admin users exist, so a lockout shows up in `logs/security.log` on the next restart.

Full CLI documentation: [`app/scripts/README_EMERGENCY_ADMIN.md`](../../app/scripts/README_EMERGENCY_ADMIN.md).

## Data Model Management

Admins can perform CRUD operations on reference data and lookup tables used throughout the system. This includes:

- **Injury Types** - Predefined injury type classifications available to all users
- **Encounter Types** - Visit/encounter type options
- **Standardized Lab Tests** - Lab test definitions with reference ranges
- **Other Lookup Tables** - Any model in the system can be viewed and managed

### How to Use

1. Navigate to **Admin Panel** > **Model Management**
2. Select a model from the list of available models
3. Browse, create, edit, or delete records
4. All changes are logged in the activity log

---

## Backup & Restore

MediKeep includes a built-in backup system for database protection.

### Creating Backups

1. Go to **Admin Panel** > **Backups**
2. Click **Create Backup**
3. The system creates a database backup and confirms when complete

### Viewing Backup History

- Browse all backups with creation date and size
- Paginated list for easy navigation

### Restoring from Backup

1. Find the backup you want to restore in the backup list
2. Click **Restore**
3. Confirm the restore operation
4. The system restores the database to the selected backup state

**Warning:** Restoring a backup replaces the current database state. Make sure to create a fresh backup before restoring an older one.

### Deleting Backups

- Remove old backups that are no longer needed
- Configure retention settings to control how long backups are kept (by days, minimum count, and maximum count)

---

## Trash Management

When records are soft-deleted by users, they go to the trash rather than being permanently removed.

- **View trashed records** - Browse soft-deleted records across all models
- **Restore records** - Recover accidentally deleted records
- **Permanently delete** - Remove records from the system entirely

---

## System Health

Monitor the health and status of your MediKeep instance:

- **Database status** - Connection health and performance
- **Storage usage** - Disk space consumption
- **System metrics** - Overview of system resource usage

---

## Activity Logging

All administrative actions are automatically recorded in the activity log:

- **What was done** - Create, read, update, or delete operations
- **Which record** - The entity type and record ID affected
- **Who did it** - The admin user who performed the action
- **When** - Timestamp of the action

This provides a complete audit trail for administrative operations.

---

## Maintenance

Admins can run maintenance tasks to keep the system clean:

- **Clean up expired invitations** - Remove invitations that have passed their expiration date
- **Purge soft-deleted records** - Permanently remove records that have been in the trash
- **Database optimization** - Run optimization routines for improved performance
