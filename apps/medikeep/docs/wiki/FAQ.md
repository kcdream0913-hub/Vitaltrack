### Does MediKeep integrate with my doctor's office?

MediKeep is designed for personal record keeping. It doesn't integrate directly with healthcare provider systems (EHRs). You can manually add information from your provider visits.

### Can I export my data?

Yes! You can:
- Generate PDF reports for any patient
- Export data via the API
- Access the PostgreSQL database directly for backups

### Does MediKeep support multiple languages?

Yes. MediKeep supports 10 languages: English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Swedish, Dutch, and Polish.

## Sharing & Access

### How do I share records with someone?

The recipient must already have an account on your MediKeep instance. To share:

1. Go to the patient's page → **Sharing**
2. Enter the recipient's username or email to look them up
3. Choose a permission level and send the invitation
4. The recipient will see the invitation in their account and can accept or decline

### What permission levels are available?

- **View** - Can see records but not modify
- **Edit** - Can view and modify records
- **Full** - Full access to the patient's records

### How do I revoke someone's access?

Go to the patient's sharing settings and remove their access.

## Troubleshooting

### I forgot my password

There is no self-service password reset. An administrator can reset your password through the admin panel.

### I lost admin access / I'm locked out of the admin panel

If your admin account was demoted, deleted, or you never had one on a fresh install, MediKeep ships with an emergency recovery script that runs against the database directly.

**One-liner recovery for the default `admin` account:**

```bash
docker exec -it <container_name> python app/scripts/create_emergency_admin.py --username admin
```

The script detects whether the user exists and either **promotes the existing user to admin** (preserving their current password — no reset) or **creates a new admin user** if no account with that username exists. It asks for confirmation before making any changes and writes both a security-log entry and an activity-log row for audit purposes.

Full documentation including all flags, scenarios (lost default admin, non-default username, creating an additional admin), exit codes, and troubleshooting is in [`app/scripts/README_EMERGENCY_ADMIN.md`](../../app/scripts/README_EMERGENCY_ADMIN.md).

MediKeep also runs a startup self-check that logs a prominent `WARNING` with the recovery command whenever it detects zero admin users in a non-empty database, so if you missed the lockout, you'll see it in `logs/security.log` on the next restart.

### The application is slow

Try:
1. Check your server resources (CPU, RAM)
2. Ensure PostgreSQL has adequate memory
3. Check for large numbers of records that may need pagination

### I can't upload files

Check:
1. File size limit (default 15MB)
2. Allowed file types (images, PDFs)
3. Storage permissions on the server

### I'm getting CORS errors

CORS is configured to allow all origins. If you're seeing CORS errors in development, make sure the backend is actually running on port 8000.
