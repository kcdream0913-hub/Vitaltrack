# Responsive Medical Forms and Tables Tests

This directory contains comprehensive tests for Phase 4 of the responsive design system implementation, focusing on medical forms and tables with responsive behavior across all device breakpoints.

## Test Structure

### 1. ResponsiveTestUtils.js

**Core testing utilities and helpers**

## Breakpoint Coverage

All tests cover the full responsive breakpoint spectrum:

| Breakpoint | Width Range | Device Type | Primary Features                               |
| ---------- | ----------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| xs         | 0-575px     | Mobile      | Cards, full-screen modals, large touch targets |
| sm         | 576-767px   | Mobile      | Cards, improved spacing                        |
| md         | 768-1023px  | Tablet      | Table + horizontal scroll, lg modals           |
| lg         | 1024-1279px | Desktop     | Full table, xl modals, all columns             |
| xl         | 1280px+     | Desktop     | Comprehensive layout, advanced features        |

## Performance Benchmarks

### Target Performance Metrics

**Render Performance:**

- Small forms (≤5 fields): <50ms
- Medium forms (6-15 fields): <100ms
- Large forms (16+ fields): <200ms
- Tables (≤100 rows): <100ms
- Tables (101-500 rows): <300ms
- Tables (500+ rows): <500ms with virtualization

**Breakpoint Transitions:**

- Mobile ↔ Desktop: <75ms
- Consecutive transitions: <50ms average

**Memory Usage:**

- Component mount/unmount cycles: Stable heap size

- Event listener cleanup: 100% cleanup rate

## Test Data

### Medical Test Data Examples

```javascript
// Medication data
{
  medication_name: 'Lisinopril',
  dosage: '10mg',
  frequency: 'Once daily',
  prescribing_practitioner: 'Dr. Smith',
  start_date: '2024-01-15',
  status: 'Active'
}

// Allergy data
{
  allergen: 'Penicillin',
  reaction_type: 'Skin rash',
  severity: 'Moderate',
  notes: 'Developed rash within 2 hours'
}
```

## Common Test Patterns

### Testing Across All Breakpoints

```javascript
testAtAllBreakpoints(<MyResponsiveComponent />, (breakpoint, viewport) => {
  it(`works at ${breakpoint}`, () => {
    // Test logic here
  });
});
```

### Performance Testing

```javascript
const { duration } = await measureAsyncRender(async () => {
  const { unmount } = renderResponsive(<Component />);
  return unmount;
});

expect(duration).toBeLessThan(100);
```

### Form Submission Testing

```javascript
await simulateFormSubmission(
  {
    medication_name: 'Test Med',
    dosage: '10mg',
  },
  'Save'
);

expect(mockOnSubmit).toHaveBeenCalledWith(
  expect.objectContaining({
    medication_name: 'Test Med',
  })
);
```

## Debugging Test Failures

### Breakpoint Issues

- Check `mockViewport()` calls are setting correct dimensions
- Verify `useResponsive` mock returns expected values
- Ensure components respond to responsive context changes

### Performance Issues

- Use `measureRenderPerformance()` to identify slow components
- Check for memory leaks with component mount/unmount cycles
- Profile large dataset rendering with browser dev tools

### Form Validation Issues

- Verify field names match between form and test
- Check async validation timing with `waitFor()`
- Ensure error states are properly triggered

## Contributing

When adding new responsive components or features:

1. **Add responsive test utilities** if needed in `ResponsiveTestUtils.js`
2. **Create comprehensive tests** covering all breakpoints
3. **Include performance benchmarks** for new components
4. **Test integration workflows** that include the new features
5. **Update this documentation** with new test patterns or data

## Test Quality Standards

- **100% breakpoint coverage** - Test at xs, sm, md, lg, xl
- **Performance benchmarks** - All components must meet timing targets
- **Accessibility testing** - ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen readers
- **Error handling** - Test validation, API errors, edge cases
- **Data integrity** - Verify data persistence across interactions
- **Integration scenarios** - Test complete user workflows
